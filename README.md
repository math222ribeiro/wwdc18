## Overview

MR Lab, features a 3D laboratory owned by me, where you can create robots.

On the first page, Mini Bot, laboratory robot assistant, guides you to create your own custom robot. You can create your robot by changing the code on the editor, to succeed you need to change the initial configuration to make your robot unique (tips and solution are available to the user in order to succeed).

After creating your robot, on the second page, you can place it on the real world using Augmented reality along with other objects from the lab and the robot assistant, on this page you are free to take the time that you want experimenting (there are no challenges).
